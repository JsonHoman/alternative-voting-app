# Alternative Voting Application

---

<b><u>Overview</u></b>: Application to create elections with candidates and/or issues. Ballots can be configured to 
have ballot selections be calculated by Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) or Score Then Automatic Runoff (STAR). The intention 
of the project is to create an internal data structure that is flexible to work with many different types of alternative 
election styles in order to best suit an organizational need, while best representing the electorate, eliminating bias 
any potential gaming or strategy working against an effective democratic process.
